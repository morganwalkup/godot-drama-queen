# Drama Queen ðŸŽ­ðŸ‘¸

A Godot plugin for writing scripted events, aka "dramas" or "cutscenes" in your game.

Those non-interactive moments where the player loses control until the characters and objects in the world have done some *thing*.

Most people author this sort of thing inside the AnimationPlayer, but DramaQueen does everything through code to give you maximum control.

Exposes a `DramaQueen` autoloaded singleton for playing `*.drama.gd` files known as `Drama` scripts.


### How to Use

First, create a script for your drama:
```py
extends Drama

func _play():
    # Your drama script goes here
```

Then, use `DramaQueen` to play the drama script at the appropriate time:
```py
const drama_script = load("res://path_to_drama/something.drama.gd")

func _ready():
    DramaQueen.play(drama_script)    
```

### How do I stop the rest of my game from interrupting the drama??

`DramaQueen` is intentionally unopinionated about the rest of your game. It won't pause the game or adjust the engine timescale while playing a `Drama`.

Your `Drama` script should be responsible for setting up any nodes involved in the `Drama`. Most likely, the first few lines of your `_play()` function will focus on setting up these nodes.

If you are using Morgan Walkup's `UtilityAI` plugin, we recommend creating a general-purpose `Drama` task that pauses the decision timer while a `Drama` is playing. All `UtilityTaskManagers` in the scene should be interrupted with the `Drama` task when the `Drama` script starts playing.


### DramaQueen Singleton

The `DramaQueen` singleton plays one `Drama` at a time end emits signals before and after playing the `Drama`.
